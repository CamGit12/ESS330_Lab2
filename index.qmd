```{r}
library(dplyr)

```

```{r}
#1-Load and Describe 
library(readr)
setwd("C:/Users/laxca/Softwares/Git/ESS330_Lab2/Data")
tree_dat <- read_csv("tree_dat.csv")
glimpse(tree_dat)

```

This is a dataframe of a forest with records of trees, including their unique ID, their stand ID, the statistics of each tree.

```{r}
#2-count the number of entries for Stand 1 in the "standID" column
sum(tree_dat$standID == 1)

```

There are 979 trees in Stand 1.

```{r}
#3-Count ABBA and PIST
sum(tree_dat$species == "ABBA" | tree_dat$species == "PIST")
```

There are 17,221 ABBA and PIST trees.

```{r}
#4-Sum trees older than 200 years old in last year
sum(tree_dat$age > 200 & tree_dat$year == 2007)
```

There are 7 trees older than 200 years old that were found in the last year of the dataset.

```{r}
#5-Oldest tree
tree_dat %>% slice_max(order_by = age, n = 1)
```

The oldest tree is 269 years old.

```{r}
#6-oldest 5 trees in 2001
tree_dat %>% filter(year == 2001) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = age, n = 5)
```

The oldest 5 trees from 2001 are 263, 259, 212, and two trees that are 2006 years old.

```{r}
#7- Using slice_sample, how many trees are in a 30% sample of those recorded in 2002?
tree_dat %>% filter(year == 2002) %>% slice_sample(prop = 0.3) %>% nrow()

```

There are 687 tress from 2002 that would be in that sample.

```{r}
#8- Filter all trees in stand 5 in 2007. Sort this subset by descending radius at breast height (rad_ib) and use slice_head() to get the top three trees. Report the tree IDs
tree_dat %>% filter(standID == 5 & year == 2007) %>% arrange(desc(rad_ib)) %>% slice_head(n = 3) %>% select(treeID)

```

The highest radius trees from stand 5, from 2007, are trees 128, 157, and 135.

```{r}
#9-reduce dataset
tree_dat %>% select(treeID, standID, year, rad_ib) %>% filter(standID == 3 & year == 2007) %>% slice_min(order_by = rad_ib, n = 3)


```

The smallest three trees from 2007 in stand 3 were tree 50, 56 and 36.

```{r}
#10-Remove stand column
tree_dat %>% select(-standID) %>% glimpse()
```

Stand column was removed.

```{r}
#11- remove columns with ID in the name
tree_dat %>% select(contains("ID")) %>% glimpse()
```

StandID and treeID are the ones we could remove.

```{r}
#12- find columns with ID and Stand
tree_dat %>% select(contains("ID") | contains("stand")) %>% glimpse()
```

Now we have the last two columns, as well as the "Stand" column.

```{r}
#13-rename rad_inc
tree_dat <- tree_dat %>% rename(rad_mm = rad_ib, inc_mm = inc)

```

The column names were fixed to include the units.

```{r}
#14-mean BA_m2 of POTR in 2007
tree_dat <- tree_dat %>% mutate(DBH = rad_mm * .1) %>% mutate(BA_m2 = 0.00007854 * DBH^2) %>% glimpse()

tree_dat %>% filter(species == "POTR" & year == 2007) %>% summarize(mean(BA_m2))
```

DBH was computed and BA was computed as well (in meters squared.) The mean BA_m2 was 369.6619.

```{r}
#15- make a column to add boolean T/F if established 5+ yr
tree_dat <- tree_dat %>% mutate(established = if_else(age > 5, TRUE, FALSE))

```

The column was made.

```{r}
#16-make new column for classifying each tree into proper DBH_class and limit dataset to 2007 and report the number of each class with count 
tree_dat <- tree_dat %>% mutate(DBH_class = case_when(DBH < 2.5 ~ "seedling", DBH < 10 ~ "sapling", DBH < 30 ~ "pole", TRUE ~ "sawlog"))

```

Trees were classified by provided categorization statistics.

```{r}
#17-compute mean and SD dbh in c, fro all 2007 trees 
tree_dat %>% filter(year == 2007) %>% summarize(mean(DBH), sd(DBH))
```

The mean DBH of the 2007 tree data illustrates that the average tree was roughly 8 cm. The standard deviation of these trees shows that 75 percent of the trees, if the distribution is normal, is roughly 3 cm more or less than the average DBH. With these two stats, we see that the majority of the trees have a dbh within this range and that the average tree is 8cm DBH.

```{r}
#18-Compute the per species mean tree age using only those ages recorded in 2003. Identify the three species with the oldest mean age.
tree_dat %>% filter(year == 2003) %>% group_by(species) %>% summarize(mean_age = mean(age)) %>% arrange(desc(mean_age))

tree_dat %>% filter(year == 2003) %>% group_by(species) %>% summarize(mean_age = mean(age)) %>% arrange(desc(mean_age)) %>% slice_head(n = 3)
```

The mean tree age from 2003 was computed, including the three with the oldest mean age (Thuja occidentalis, Fraxinus nigra, Pinus strobus)

```{r}
#19- In a single summarize call, find the number of unique years with records in the data set along with the first and last year recorded?
tree_dat %>% summarize(unique_years = n_distinct(year), first_year = min(year), last_year = max(year))
```

The number of unique years with records in the dataset was 111, and the first year was 1897, the last was 2007.

```{r}
#20-Determine the stands with the largest number of unique years recorded. Report all stands with largest (or tied with the largest) temporal record.

tree_dat %>% group_by(standID) %>% summarize(unique_years = n_distinct(year)) %>% filter(unique_years == max(unique_years))

```

The stands with the largest number of unique years recorded were 1, 15, 16, 17, and 24. All of these had the same number of unique years, 111.

```{r}
#Final

#Compute annual DBH growth per tree 
tree_dat <- tree_dat %>%
  arrange(treeID, year) %>%
  group_by(treeID) %>%
  mutate(dbh_growth = DBH - lag(DBH)) %>%
  ungroup()

#trees with at least a 10yr growth record
tree_dat_filtered <- tree_dat %>%
  group_by(treeID) %>%
  filter(n() >= 10)

#mean and standard deviation of DBH growth by species
species_growth_stats <- tree_dat_filtered %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(mean_growth = mean(dbh_growth, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_growth = sd(dbh_growth, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_growth))

# fastest- and slowest-growing species
fastest_species <- species_growth_stats %>% slice_max(mean_growth, n = 3)
slowest_species <- species_growth_stats %>% slice_min(mean_growth, n = 3)

# Display results

print(fastest_species)

print(slowest_species)


```

The three fastest growing species by mean growth rates, by USDA species codes, were PIRE, POTR and PIBA. The slowest were LALA\< THOC, and QURU.
